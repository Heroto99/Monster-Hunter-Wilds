The ultimate hunting experience awaits you in Monster Hunter Wilds.

* Story

A few years past, a young boy named Nata was rescued at the border of the Forbidden Lands, an unexplored region the guild has yet to survey.
After hearing the boyâ€™s tale of his lone escape from a mysterious monster that attacked his village, the Guild organized an expedition into the Forbidden Lands to investigate.

* A Living World

Environments within the Forbidden Lands can drastically change as the weather shifts constantly and suddenly. During the harsh Fallow and perilous Inclemency periods, ravenous monsters will venture out to hunt in packs, yet during the Plenty periods, wildlife is rich and abundant.

* Monsters

The monsters who inhabit these environments have been forced to adapt to the dynamic changes that occur, using their unique characteristics to survive and thrive.

* Hunting

As the world around them changes, so must the hunters and their tactics. Not only will hunters have a multitude of weapons and armor to choose from, but the art of the hunt itself has evolved as hunters learn to anticipate monstersâ€™ behavior and familiarize themselves with their environment.

* Characters

From hunting partners to fellow expedition members, youâ€™ll encounter plenty of those who will support you on your journey.
